I probably went over the top with the artwork. I was feeling especially irritated with politics the last few weeks. An interesting thing that happened when I was trying to get an AI to help me write the prompt was, it initially said what I was asking for wasn't allowed, but it would make "likenesses" to substituite. It even suggested it would make Peter Thiel a Vampire, which I hadn't even requested him, so that was interesting. Eventually, it kept giving an error, and I was like ok forget it. So I used Nightcafe and just did my best to word it - and apparently the American Oligarch that AI art dislikes the most is Bezos. I finally got it to make a likeness of Musk and it took quite a few tries. The other odd thing was I didn't ask it to create images of "anonymous" but it seemed to think that was part of the image which I also thought was interesting. Whatever it had been fed recently seemed to be affecting it!

Overall, getting the CDN library to work for Jquery was significantly less difficult, thank goodness, because last week was hard. I didn't have as much trouble with this array. I did have trouble with timing and adjusted it quite a few times. Still don't love it, but it at least feels like there is time to read it all.
