With a flourish of his cloak, he vanishes into the steam-filled night. You set off, navigating the bustling streets filled with steam-powered carriages and towering airships. Automatons tip their hats as you pass, their gears whirring in polite acknowledgment. The city pulses with life, a symphony of hissing steam and clanking metal.

Reaching the Clockwork Cathedral, you insert the key into a hidden lock. The massive doors creak open, revealing a labyrinth of gears and pistons. You race against time, dodging mechanical guardians and solving intricate puzzles. Finally, you reach the altar, where the Chrono Crystal glows with an ethereal light. As you grasp it, the city seems to hold its breath, waiting for the dawn of a new era.</p>

As he disappears into the mist, you turn away, the bustling metropolis still alive with its mechanical wonders. You wander the streets, watching airships soar above and automatons go about their duties. The city is a marvel, but you can't shake the feeling that you've missed out on something extraordinary.

Suddenly, a small automaton scurries up to you, its eyes glowing with a soft blue light. It hands you a tiny, intricately crafted music box. As you wind it up, a haunting melody fills the air, and you realize that even in your refusal, the city has gifted you a piece of its magic. The music box's tune lingers in your mind, a reminder of the adventure that could have been.</p>

London, 1887. The air is thick with soot and secrecy, the gas lamps flickering in defiance of the smog. You tread carefully through the damp alleyways, your boots echoing against cobblestone streets slick with evening mist. The letter in your coat pocket is sealed with black wax, stamped with an insignia you do not recognize—a serpent entwined with a dagger. It had arrived without explanation, slipped under your door as if by ghostly hands.<br><br>
You reach the unmarked door as instructed. A single knock. A pause. Then, it creaks open just enough to reveal the glint of watchful eyes. No words are spoken. You step inside.<br><br>
The room beyond is dimly lit by candelabras dripping wax like blood. Hooded figures stand in a circle, their faces obscured, their eyes burning through the shadows. The scent of old books, ink, and something metallic—like rust or dried blood—lingers in the air.<br><br>
A man steps forward. His voice is velvet over steel.<br><br>
"You stand at the threshold of something far greater than yourself. The world outside is blind, shackled by ignorance. But we... we see beyond the veil. We unearth truths long buried. We shape the fate of nations from the darkness in which we dwell."<br><br>
He gestures to a table draped in crimson cloth. Upon it, a quill and a ledger, its pages aged and yellowed. Names fill its lines—some crossed out, others stained, perhaps with ink… or something else.<br><br>
"One mark, and you are bound to us. No king, no parliament, no god shall own you. Only the pursuit of power, knowledge, and the unseen forces that weave the fabric of this world. But beware—once the ink dries, there is no turning back."<br><br>
The candlelight wavers. The air grows heavy. Behind you, the door has closed.</p>
                   <img src="./imgs/letter.jpg" alt="letter">
                   <button class="choice-btn" onclick="choose('yes')">Lift the veil</button>

"Welcome," he says, "to the Order of the Serpent. Your journey into the arcane begins now."
As the ink dries, you feel a strange warmth spread through your body, as if ancient knowledge is being etched into your very soul. The room seems to shift, the shadows deepening, and you realize that you have crossed a threshold into a world hidden from ordinary sight.</p>

"Very well," he replies, his tone icy. "But know this: once you leave, you can never return."
The hooded figures part, creating a path to the door. As you turn to leave, the air grows colder, and the shadows seem to reach out, as if reluctant to let you go. You step outside, the door closing behind you with a final, echoing thud. The alleyway feels darker, the mist thicker, and you can't shake the feeling that you have just walked away from a destiny that will forever remain a mystery.<br><br>Aghhhh! Your stomach cramps, your heart pounds, your vision begins to go black...</p>
