This was technically difficult for me. I had to redo a lot of things and centering things seems to continue to be an issue for me. I added css, everything broke, took it away, it came back together, readded with adjustments, anyway, as you can see most things ended up not centered. The story piece was easy for me. When I took the gaming class my final project was a version of this. This is the watered down version I could create here, but it was still fun to do and I enjoyed that aspect of it. I could have kept up the choices for a while! All the art was created using NightCafe. I like all the options they have and I feel like it also did a good job of keeping in the theme of things.The AI actually did a really good job for itself, I didn't adjust any of the coding at all. I didn't add at all to the story it created. I did use NightCafe to create images for it, because it looked a little sad without them. Adding the images I do think really upped the look for the story.<br>
Overall, despite how many times I revised the code, I did really enjoy the project. I feel a little better about things this week and it feels like my brain is unarchiving all the coding knowledge!
