This was fun - I've also always been a fan of shoving everything on one page!  I have gotten a lot better about being neater with my code, which was obviously through some hard lessons!  I started wanting to make this more elaborate with a fancier background, and I had to dial it back. A few things just weren't working, and after restarting a few times, I decided it was just easier to go for the more simple look. I had trouble with the restarting of the game, and I did end up running it all through chatgpt, which did fix the issue, and also cleaned it all up a bit. and I just discovered it is still not working...so, I'm not really sure what the issue is.
