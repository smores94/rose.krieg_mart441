Overall I liked how this assignment went. I wanted to try using the lettering, but the link in git seemed broken and despite whatever search terms I used (which obviously weren't the right ones) I couldn't seem to find a substitute. This assignment gave me a lot of ideas for a future website, so at least I have the flip thing in my pocket to try out!
