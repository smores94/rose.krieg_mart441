I have absolutely forgotten how to do everything. I had to google, look at old files, google again. And this is after I created a website for my department at my actual job. I clearly haven't updated it recently, so that is on my list of things to do. I wanted to work on the parallax scrolling, but because I have a full-time job that has gotten busy the last week and my daughter, honestly I didn't think it would be that hard to "whip something up" - so that was a terrible idea. I don't hate what I put together but with a little more time it could have been nicer.
