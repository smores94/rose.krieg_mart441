This was kind of nightmare. I worked on this so many hours I don't even want to admit to it, and I ended up scrapping all of it and starting over with switch statements - because the else if kept getting everything confused (not sure if there is a better, nested way to do it, but it just was not working) so I moved to switch and that worked, sort of, but I ended up having to go through and rename all the choices so everything went the correct path. I also ended up eliminating my third storyline, because it just felt like so much after all the work on it. my formatting also seemed to take a hit, and I can't even explain why, considering it was the same style sheet from before and shouldn't have really had an effect on it all. I had scoring as part of it, but I am struggling with having it work to actually calculate it and keep track.  
The AI version is pretty bare bones, and I did not provide it any images this go around, as I was still trying to figure out my own stuff. 
As I'm typing this, I'm thinking I should have revised the switch to go 1, 2, 3, etc, instead of adding a letter to it. More to ponder for future projects.
